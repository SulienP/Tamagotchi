# Do not work
**The time implementation does not work.
It has been considered almost implemented but is not functional.
This means that the tamagotchi is immortal and does not change state.**All other functions are functiona.
To be able to check the different states of the tamagotchi, you can define in the tamagotchi values ​​what should be changed.
If you want to age the tamagotchi, delete the save file and restart the games by changing the state value to 1 or 2 or 3 or 4To be able to check the different states of the tamagotchi, you can define in the tamagotchi values ​​what should be changed.
